indoctrinate
To convince others to [see things] your way no matter what you have to do to get them to agree. Often by using threatening and [false accusations] against someone, something, or any idea that does [not fit] into the concept of how you personally think or feel it should be, for whatever reason you have, at any given time or moment.

Note- This does not guarantee the fact that some people that have an actual clue, will not see through your bullshit and total lies,

The whole cherry-picking based on vibe-gauging is utter BS. They consistently turn away people of colour and foreigners, which kind of defeats the purpose of the club. I’m sure the experience is unique but I’m not about to queue for hours only to be rejected because I’m latino and don’t speak German.

(Translated by Google) There are several scary, fat Germans who think they are very cool. The entry policy is simply disgusting - I want to let in, I want not to let me in. This is despite the fact that sometimes you have to stand in the cold for several hours, at a time when the subway and other transport no longer run. honestly, it's not worth it, trust me. With such an attitude towards customers, you do not want to go to this club.

"On arrival, myself and another female traveller were taken to a small room with one single bed in it - they still had to build a bed for one of us. I was under the impression I had booked a bunk in a 6 bed female only dorm.

They told us to go out or go downstairs to the pub when really, I just wanted to sleep after a long journey.

There was no lock on the room door. I believe the owner had to put locks on as were waiting for access to the room.
[15:08:04] (2.1) victor: There was also a general feeling of discomfort and not feeling entiry safe.

In the room there was a cupboard with no door that was full of junk. The room was also full of broken electrical equipment.

The facilities were unclean too. Myself and the other female traveller were so unhappy that we didn't even stay. We left as soon as we could and booked somewhere else that was cheaper and more professional.

Do not book this hostel. I don't believe it even passes for a hostel.

Low testosterone can cause you to lose some facial hair, pubic hair, and hair on your arms and lower legs. But one thing you should know. There's a link between testosterone therapy and male-pattern balding. Your doctor can talk to you about any side effects of testosterone treatment.20 Dec 2020

Or the king's real, or his stampèd face

         So you will let me love.
