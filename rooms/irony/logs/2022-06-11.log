Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin alphabet and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts. During this time, the Irish language absorbed some Latin words, some via Old Welsh,

After seven months of bloody conflict, Swiss and Austrians signed the Treaty of Basel (1499 CE), which exempted the Swiss from imperial jurisdiction and taxes.

Thick As A Brick
The definition of "masterpiece." [Jethro Tull's] definitive progressive rock concept album. The whole album is one 45-minute long song. The lyrics appear to have some deep hidden meaning on the surface, but [delving deeper], they are actually satirical, done with Monty-Python style humor. The music is complex, [seemless], moving, and is undefinable to just one genre.
