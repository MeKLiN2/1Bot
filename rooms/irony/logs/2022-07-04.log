Each card will contain an 100x100 pixel image of a 2x2 inch region of randomly selected skin on the legs or torso of a naked human female, but not consisting of any part of the head, genitals, hands, feet or breasts.  10% of the cards are from the body of a naked child. 90% of the cards are  from the body of an adult porn star.  The card position is randomized.
[13:36:08] (2.2) Happy_4th_of_July: To play the game, you must click to match pairs, not knowing what any given picture is of. The game ends when you either clear 10% of the board by matching porn pictures(6 pairs) or you lose the game. If you match two cards from porn stars, you gain a point and the cards are removed from the board. If you match an illicit and a non-illicit card, you lose a point, the sound of a clock begins to tick, but no indication is given of what card was illicit, and no cards are removed.
[13:36:17] (2.0) Happy_4th_of_July: If you successfully reach 6 points and don't lose the game, the game will end and the display will show CONGRATS, YOU ARE NOT A PEDO and play Johnny Cash - I Walk the Line. However, If you accidentally commit three point loss matches in a row or if you match two pictures of illicit content once, your ip is sent to the authorities, the display says YOU ARE A PEDO and begins playing Oingo Boingo – Little Girls on maximum volume, the browser freezes, and the game ends.
