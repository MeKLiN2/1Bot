For example, if your home is 1,500 square meters and your office is 300 square meters, your office is 20% of your home's total size. That means you are able to deduct 20% of many home expenses as home office expenses on your tax return.

[13:01:51] (2.0) plusvat: As the name suggests, Green Crack is a strongly uplifting and motivating Sativa.

This is another strain we chose because it’s a heavy yielder with up to 500g/m2 possible.

It grows to a maximum of 120cm, which leaves plenty of room for lights and airflow.

Green Crack responds well to ‘topping’, a growth management technique that encourages shorter plants.

This delicious strain is easy to grow, relatively compact, and has a THC level of around 19%.

[16:21:42] (2.0) guest: Gradually the Turks tired of Sabbatai's schemes. They ended his doorkeeper's salary and banished him to Constantinople. When he was discovered singing psalms with Jews, the grand vizier ordered his banishment. At the beginning of 1673, the sultan had Zevi exiled to Ulcinj (Dulcigno, Turkish: Ulkum).[20] His wife died there in 1674, after which Zevi married Esther, the daughter of rabbi Joseph Filosoff of Thessaloniki.[20]
