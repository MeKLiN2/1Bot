[07:49:45] (2.2) GOVERNMENT_MONITORED_CHAT_ROOM: Then my mind used the illusion to create experiences and information corresponding to a person who behaves in accordance with the expectations created by the illusory self with no basis in reality. finally, my mind decomposed the perfected experiences into an illusory, holographic copy of the attributes this person might have, with no basis in reality what-so-ever, and then finally, I inflicted this upon Sasha.

Then, she began more and more to resist and even to resent the deitification/demonization of her character(different people proceeded the simulacra differently according to their nature), and before the end, she took drastic efforts to try to correct the truthfulness or limit efforts to proceed the simulacra, although these were futile.
