[08:45:36] (2.0) DEGENERACY: >According to creator Vince Gilligan, this was a "bottle episode." Because the season was already "hopelessly over budget," it became necessary to create an episode with minimal production costs. By filming in one location and using the fewest number of actors in the series ever, "Fly" cost substantially less than the average episode.

In 1985, Curtis had been convicted for dealing cocaine; after cooperating with investigators, he served less than half of his original sentence. He was soon perceived as a "snitch" and was disliked by other drug users

[09:24:33] (2.0) Degeneracy: >As an organiser in BNP Youth, the youth wing of the British National Party, Renshaw appeared in a much-derided 2014 video titled "BNP Youth Fight Back" which railed against "cultural Marxism", "militant homosexuals", "heartless Zionists", "political correctness", Islam, immigration, multiculturalism, Doreen Lawrence and other perceived societal ills and a perceived eradication of British identity.[8]
