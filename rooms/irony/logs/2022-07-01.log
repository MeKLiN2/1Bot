[12:07:44] (2.0) professional_weak_guy: In contrast with what secular and non-Islamic religious sources say about bestiality, this is what the Qur'an has to say on the subject:


That's right - absolutely, positively nothing. Unlike the Qur'an's clear-cut rulings on the morality of homosexuality, Polygamy, rape, and pedophilia, the permissibility of bestiality seems to have been left open to ‘interpretation.’

If Islamic teachings were truly opposed to such a practice, then this omission is somewhat surprising when you consider that,

The other Muslim countries are Egypt at number 2, Iran at 4, Morocco at 5, Saudi Arabia at 7 and Turkey at 8. Non-Muslim states are Vietnam at 3, India at 6, Philippines at 9 and Poland at 10.

[12:09:23] (2.0) professional_weak_guy: From all of the above, we can certainly see that, unlike the West, Islamic societies do not universally harbor negative attitudes towards bestiality. Many Muslims seek out gratification or are indifferent to this perversion, and in some cases it is even openly promoted and made obligatory.

[12:09:57] (2.0) professional_weak_guy: This is all in stark contrast with their attitudes towards homosexuality and their allowance of pedophilia. Therefore to claim that the West without the guidance of Islam has allowed bestiality is not only false, but hypocritical when you consider that this perversion, alongside pedophilia, is left largely unhindered by the Islamic clerisy in their societies and runs rampant among followers of Islam.

[17:51:35] (2.0) victor: Most of the 10 young men attended the same school in Moston. They were convicted of plotting violent revenge for the killing of their friend — a 16-year-old aspiring rapper called Alexander John Soyoye, who performed drill music under the name “MD”.

None of those named as targets in the Telegram chat were hurt, though three of the defendants went on to violently attack two other boys using machetes and a car as a weapon.

The girl in the video, now 17, was identified by her aunt, who said that her niece would have been 14 at the time the tape was made, based on her appearance. Kelly can also be heard on the tape referring to the girl by her first name.
