[08:08:49] (2.0) Ape: Let’s start with neoclassical theory. When Charles Wilson claimed that ‘what’s good for GM is good for the country’, he was ridiculed. His problem, basically, was that he articulated neoclassical theory too clearly. Stripped of its mathematical mystique, neoclassical logic is obvious bullshit. When Amazon stock prices triple, that’s good for Amazon owners (i.e. Jeff Bezos). But for everyone else, the benefit is hard to see.

Given the dubious social benefit of rising stocks, Marxist theory swing

With an average hourly rate of $6, Los Angeles' fashion district is predicated on a vulnerable workforce of largely undocumented immigrants. Workers of this underground economy are often subjected to wage theft, intimidation and poor health and safety conditions.

It imported to Japan in the 1950s, around the time of its creation in America, and remains an active style to this day. The fashion is primarily recognized for its Elvis-like style for men, and it's poodle skirt style for women.

Improved cardio-respiratory function means that the body is able to perform exercise much more efficiently. This results mainly from the body more effectively getting oxygen into the blood stream and transporting it to the working muscles, where it is needed for the metabolic processing of energy.

Yet contrary to warnings that the Soviets might eventually ‘swallow’ all of sub-Saharan Africa,2 by 1990 the offensive had fizzled

Accountants working for the families discussed the possibility of recasting interest owed by the Kolber trust to two US-based Bronfman funds as “services rendered”, on the basis that the loans were not “in substance (only in form)”. Tax experts say that such interest-free loans would generally be barred under US tax laws.
