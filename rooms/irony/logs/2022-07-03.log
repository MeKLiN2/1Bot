However, some evidence in the Despicable Me universe points toward a possibility that the Minions not only served Hitler and Stalin, but engaged in a brutal civil war that nearly wiped out the species as a whole.

He think he's somebody 
Who walks along the universe 
And tells his God that nothing could be worse 
Than staying awake at this movie 
It's dumb and it's tough and it is really boring

Then Gabriel whose head was covered with dust, came to him saying, "You have put down your arms! By Allah, I have not put down my arms yet." Allah's Apostle said, "Where (to go now)?" Gabriel said, "This way," pointing towards the tribe of Bani Quraiza. So Allah's Apostle went out towards them.Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:52:68

Once a Cancer trusts you, they make for staunch and supportive friends. Cancers are often fiercely loyal and love unconditionally. However, be warned: if you betray a Cancer’s trust, the sting of their anger may cut deep.
