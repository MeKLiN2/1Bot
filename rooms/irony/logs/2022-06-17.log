[00:23:22] (2.0) truuce: Drugs like marijuana, opium, and heroin were readily available in the city. In fact, they were sometimes sold by children on street corners. Finally, there was an enormous black market for stolen goods in Saigon. Many of the items for sale came from U.S. military shipments.

Many South Vietnamese people found it tempting to become involved in such illegal activities. After all, a young woman who worked as a prostitute could earn more money in a week than her peasant family would ordinarily earn
[00:23:38] (2.0) truuce: in a year. Some Vietnamese used their newfound wealth to buy luxury goods such as electric rice cookers, bicycles, and televisions. These people formed a new, privileged urban class that turned the structure of Saigon society upside down. Suddenly, construction workers and drug dealers made much more money than policemen and soldiers in the South Vietnamese army.

[10:11:37] (2.0) gap: Brining keeps chicken incredibly moist while adding an excellent flavour. It's a bit more labour intensive than a simple spice rub, but it's worth the effort for that extra special chicken dinner. Brining is basically soaking meat in a salt water solution, but the flavour doesn't stop at just salt.

[10:12:18] (2.0) gap: Brining is a way to help tenderize lean meats such as poultry—or fish or seafood—because lean meats can easily dry out when cooked. Soaking the meats in a brining solution helps ensure moist, juicy cooked meat. It's best to use natural meats—those that have not been injected with a salt solution—for brining.May 2, 2007
