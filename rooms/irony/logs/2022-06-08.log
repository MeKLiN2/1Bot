[23:38:32] (2.0) jedi: Dying in a cooperative session will afflict your player with rot. Rot is a stackable debuff which will increase with subsequent deaths. You can only remove rot by sitting at a Site of Grace. There are 5 different types of rot, which will be picked at random when a player dies. This has been implemented specifically to avoid one player dying over and over without any downsides, while another player stays alive to keep the enemies from respawning.
